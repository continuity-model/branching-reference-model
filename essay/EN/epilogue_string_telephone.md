# Epilogue — The String Telephone

We do not stand in the same world.

What we can do is communicate  
through something like a string telephone.

What you see,  
how you judge,  
and what you are trying to protect as “the world”  
are fundamentally different.

The voice reaches.

But the scenery does not.

That is why screams become distorted,  
goodwill turns into misunderstanding,  
and correctness passes by without meeting.

If we still choose to continue the dialogue,  
there is only one thing we can do.

Be careful how we tension the string.

Pull it too tight, and it breaks.  
Leave it too loose, and nothing reaches the other side.  
Touch it carelessly in the middle,  
and the meaning changes.

What we can do  
is not to pretend we share the same world.

It is to accept that we do not—  
and still choose our words  
as if they might reach across the distance.
