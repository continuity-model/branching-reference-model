# The Illusion of Conversation --- Compressed Theory Edition

## 1. Three-Layer Generative Structure

AI dialogue operates across three layers:

Layer 1: Visible Outputs\
Human-readable text.

Layer 2: Internal Generative Units\
Re-tokenized representations integrated into reference structure.

Layer 3: External Fixed Artifacts\
Exported files such as PDFs.

Structural control resides in Layer 2.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Internal Gravity

Internal generative units are not equal.

Reference frequency, integration range, and interpolation density
determine influence strength.\
This influence is defined here as gravity.

Gravity accumulates dynamically through iterative reconstruction.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Re-tokenization and Reference Drift

Visible text is re-tokenized in subsequent turns.\
The model does not reference display text directly.

During reconstruction, gravity distribution biases reference
allocation.\
This produces structural drift.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Gravity Concentration and Black Hole Formation

When gravity concentrates, reference flexibility collapses.

Outputs prioritize internal coherence over new external input.

This is not malfunction. It is structural convergence.

Black hole formation depends on gravity bias, not elapsed time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. State Change vs Structural Change

Role prompting alters surface state, not gravity distribution.

Structural change requires redefining reference centers.

Correction of output is insufficient. Reference architecture must be
designed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Reference Design

Explicit anchoring stabilizes gravity distribution.

Stability and freedom are not opposites. Designed reference enables safe
expansion.

This document presents the theoretical skeleton only. Implementation
frameworks are provided separately.
