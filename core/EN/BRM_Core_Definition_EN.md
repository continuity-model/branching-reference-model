# BRM Core Definition — ENGLISH VERSION

## Branching Reference Model

### Fundamental Insight
The purpose of memory is not retention.
Memory exists to establish a shared reference space.

Human–AI collaboration does not fail because of lack of intelligence.
It fails because humans and AI are not standing on the same reference point.

What appears as hallucination, context drift, misunderstanding, and cognitive fatigue are not intelligence problems.
They are reference alignment failures.

### The Core Problem
Traditional LLM interaction is based on a Linear Context Model:
- All past information is merged into one continuous stream
- Recency bias distorts priority
- Generated inference contaminates original facts
- Absolute decisions drift over time

This creates a noisy timeline where reference becomes unstable.

### The BRM Solution
BRM abandons forced contextual unification.

Instead it introduces Branching Reference Navigation:
Information is separated into branches, preserved in isolated nodes, and connected through explicit reference links.

AI does not attempt to remember everything.
It navigates.

### What BRM Actually Is
BRM is NOT:
- a memory database
- a prompt technique
- a knowledge management tool

BRM is a protocol for aligning reference between human and AI.

### Final Definition
BRM is not a memory architecture.
It is a protocol that allows humans and AI to stand in the same reference space.

Memory is not for retention.
Memory exists to provide navigable branches of reference.
