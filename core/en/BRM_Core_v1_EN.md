# BRM Core Principles v1.0

## Definition

Behavioral Reference Memory (BRM) is a continuity control model for AI
interaction in which contextual stability is maintained through explicit
structural references rather than probabilistic completion.

## Core Principles

### 1. Structural Continuity Principle

**Rule:** Continuity is preserved through explicit structural
references, not through textual accumulation.

### 2. Explicit Anchor Formation Principle

**Rule:** Anchors can only be created through explicit confirmation
processes.

### 3. Non-Generative Anchor Principle

**Rule:** Generated outputs must never become anchors by default.

### 4. Reference-Based Jump Resolution Principle

**Rule:** Thought discontinuities must be resolved by referencing
existing anchors rather than by probabilistic completion.

### 5. Session Independence Principle

**Rule:** Continuity is independent of conversational sessions.

## Core Insight

BRM reframes memory from accumulated conversational context to
explicitly confirmed structural continuity.
