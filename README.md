# Branching Reference Model (BRM)

![Linear vs BRM](docs/img/linear_vs_brm_v2.png)

A structural framework for stabilizing long-term AI collaboration.

## Why AI Collaboration Breaks

Long conversations appear stable.

Beneath the surface:
- Meaning drifts  
- Anchors dissolve  
- Context collapses  
- Internal bias accumulates  

This is not an intelligence failure.  
It is a structural continuity problem.

## Structural Evolution of Internal Control

| Aspect | Role Prompting | Context Accumulation | Anchoring | BRM |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|-----------|------|
| Long-term stability | Low | Medium | High | **Very High** |
| Drift resistance | Low | Medium | High | **Structural** |
| Rule persistence | Low | Medium | **High** | **Very High** |
| Role fixation | Temporary | Context-dependent | **Stable** | **Structural + Recoverable** |
| Recoverability | No | Limited | Partial | **Yes** |
| Structural visibility | Hidden | Hidden | Semi-explicit | **Explicit** |

- **Role Prompting**: Behavioral instruction at initialization.
- **Context Accumulation**: Stability through memory stacking.
- **Anchoring**: Structural control of internal reference priority.
- **BRM**: Explicit scoping architecture with recoverable reference slots.

## Before the Model — Anchoring Theory

Prompts dissolve.

What governs AI output is not the first command — but the strongest internal reference field formed during interaction.

## Capability Expansion (Separate Axis)

BRM does not compete with RAG or extended context windows.

Those approaches expand **capacity**.  
BRM stabilizes **reference scope**.

These are different architectural variables.

## Final Thought

AI collapse is not chaos.

It is gravity without design.

The industry keeps expanding context windows.  
Without structural anchors, we are only expanding the ocean.
